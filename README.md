# BirthdayNotifier

Side project I built because I forget its peoples birthdays until its about halfway through the day

download everything, Birthday.py is the GUI used to set birthdays and names, and a button that shows you all names and birthdays

birthdayNotifier checks if anyones birthday is that month then if anyones is the day of, it will ONLY open a gui if someones birthday is the same day, if no ones birthday is that day, it will just do nothing

Data.txt is an empty text that Will be appended to every new entry for name and birthday, it also tells you how old they are turning

# NOTICE

#   FORMAT BIRTHDAY IN MM/DD/YEAR

like january 23, 2010
example 23/01/2010
